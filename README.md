## Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I am a Full-Stack developer with a passion for creating efficient and elegant front-end solutions using JavaScript, Dart and Flutter. While my back-end skills include experience working with Python and different types of databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Kafka, and Redis.

I have a technical degree in web development from SENAI and I am currently finishing my bachelor's degree in Information Systems at UDESC. In addition, I will also be attending a business course extension in Berlin, Germany while completing my studies at UDESC.

On this profile, you will find a variety of projects that demonstrate my skills and experience in these technologies. I am always looking to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends.

Feel free to have a look around and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to say hi.

Thank you for visiting!
